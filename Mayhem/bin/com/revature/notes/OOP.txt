Inheritance
	When a programming language allows for a hierarchy. 
	Child objects obtain states and behaviors from parent objects
	Multiple Inheritance does not exist in Java, but that can be bypassed using interfaces.   
Encapsulation
	When you wrap and protect data fields, preventing manipulation outside of the class.
	Usually require getter and setter methods to change these values. 
	Conceal internal state of the object. Preserving integrity
Polymorphism
	The ability for the programming language to be able to tell the difference between objects and methods of the 
	same names with different variable/class types.
	Overriding - same name, same parameters, different behaviors.
	Overloading - same name, different parameters
	Multiple "is-a" relationships
	Object > Animal > Cat
	Animal IS-A Animal, and also an object 
	Cat IS-A Cat, animal, and object
	Covariance
Abstraction
	Sometimes omitted from pillars of OOP
	Hiding the implementation details
	"What it does, NOT how it does it"
	We are exposing only functionality 
	Abstract Class-abstract methods have no implementation
